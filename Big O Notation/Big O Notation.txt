-can measure in time complexity or space complexity
-O(1), O(log(n)), O(n^2), O(n), O(nlog(n)) are the general complexities 
        -make sure when calculating time complexity to simplify down and think of the big picture
-O(1) with only operations in time
-O(n) with blocks like for and while loops in which the output grows proportionally as the input increases
-O(n^2) with nested loops like nested for loops (think about bubble sort)
-O(log(n)) and O(nlog(n)) in later algorithms
-more efficient to work with O(1), O(log(n)), O(n), O(nlog(n)), and O(n^2) in that particular order
-primitives take O(1) space and Strings are O(n) space where n is the String length
-reference types O(n) and n is length of array or object key numbers
