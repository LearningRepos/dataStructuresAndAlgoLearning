# dataStructuresAndAlgoLearning

This repo is my code from Colt Steele'a Data Structures Course which gave me a high level of various data structures and algorithms in Javascript such as linked lists, binary search trees, binary heaps,etc.

## Installation

Just clone this repository to access my code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mihir-Achyuta/dataStructuresAndAlgoLearning.git
```

## Usage

Instead of using node to run the file, you can copy paste it in the client side and run it in the chrome console if you prefer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mihir-Achyuta/dataStructuresAndAlgoLearning.git
cd dataStructuresAndAlgoLearning
cd randomFolder
node jsFilename.js
```

## What I Learnt

I learnt these data structures and algorithms at a high level so I still have to work on my implementation skills with various ones with Leetcode or any coding interview site to fully understand each individual data structure and algorithms

Big O -> Arrays and Objects -> Niche Problem Solving Patterns -> Recursion -> Bubble/Selection/Insertion/Merge/Quick Sort -> Singly Linked Lists -> Double Linked Lists -> Stacks/Queues -> Binary Search Trees -> DFS/BFS -> Binary Heaps -> Hash Tables -> Graphs and Traversing them -> Dijkstra's Algorithm
