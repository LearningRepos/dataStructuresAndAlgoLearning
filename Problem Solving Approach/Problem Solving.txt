-an algorithm is a set of steps that accomplishes a task and asked commonly in coding interviews


1.
-understand the problem by asking important questions beforehand before actually doing
        -restate problem in own words?
        -inputs and outputs to problems?
                -what should output look like?
        -can outputs be determined by just the inputs?
-how should I label the most important pieces of data and classify them


2.Give concrete examples
        -make test cases by formulating inputs and outputs
        -start small and go on to edge cases later on


3.Break it down
        -think or write out the logic/pseudocode before you actually start coding


4. Solve or simplify
        -actually code step by step


5. Look back and refactor
        -see if any time efficiency or readable improvements can be made once the code is actually finished
